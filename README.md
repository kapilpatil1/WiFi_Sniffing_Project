Wi-Fi Sniffing ‚Äì Cyber Security Analysis and Network Vulnerability Detection

üîç Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Wi-Fi sniffing techniques to analyze wireless network security and data transmission vulnerabilities.
The goal was to explore how wireless packets are captured, analyzed, and interpreted, and how the same techniques can be used for ethical penetration testing and security auditing.

Wi-Fi sniffing is widely used in cybersecurity to monitor, diagnose, and secure wireless networks.
Through this project, I learned how sniffing tools intercept data packets traveling through a network, how attackers can misuse such data, and how to defend against these threats using strong encryption protocols and network monitoring systems.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Work / Implementation
1. Research & Concept Building

Studied the basics of network packet transmission, TCP/IP architecture, and OSI layers.

Researched wireless communication vulnerabilities and how data packets can be intercepted.

Compared wired vs. wireless network sniffing and learned how data is broadcast in Wi-Fi environments.

2. Tool Installation and Configuration

Set up and tested the following tools in a controlled environment:

Tool	Description	Purpose
Wireshark	A GUI-based packet analyzer for real-time traffic monitoring.	Used to capture and inspect Wi-Fi packets.
Aircrack-ng	A suite of wireless network auditing tools.	Used for WPA/WPA2 handshake capture and decryption testing.
Kismet	Wireless detector and sniffer.	Used for identifying hidden networks and devices.
Tcpdump	Command-line packet capture tool.	Used for lightweight packet analysis and scripting automation.
3. Practical Implementation

Configured the Wi-Fi adapter in monitor mode using Aircrack-ng (airmon-ng start wlan0).

Captured packets from an open Wi-Fi network using Wireshark and Tcpdump.

Analyzed the captured data:

Examined source and destination MAC addresses.

Identified protocols (HTTP, DNS, ARP, ICMP).

Checked for unencrypted data or visible credentials in plain text.

Performed handshake capture using Aircrack-ng for WPA2 network authentication.

Simulated ethical sniffing in a lab network environment to ensure legality and data privacy.

4. Risk Assessment & Countermeasures

After identifying vulnerabilities, I proposed several security hardening measures:

Enabling WPA3 encryption instead of outdated WEP/WPA protocols.

Using VPNs to encrypt all network traffic end-to-end.

Regularly updating router firmware and changing default passwords.

Implementing Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS).

Conducting regular network audits using automated scripts.

5. Documentation and Reporting

Created a comprehensive project report summarizing all phases ‚Äî theory, practical steps, screenshots, and results.

Included findings, preventive measures, and future research directions such as AI-based packet inspection.

üí° Key Learnings & Outcomes

Learned how Wi-Fi networks transmit and encrypt data packets.

Understood how ethical hackers and security analysts use sniffing tools responsibly.

Gained hands-on experience with real cybersecurity tools and live packet data.

Developed awareness of privacy laws, data security ethics, and defensive networking.

Built confidence in using Linux terminal commands for network configuration and security testing.

üîÆ Future Scope

Integration of AI/ML algorithms to automatically detect malicious patterns in packet flows.

Expanding the project to cover IoT and 5G networks, which have unique security challenges.

Developing a custom dashboard to visualize captured network data and highlight threats in real time.

Creating an educational cybersecurity toolkit based on the sniffing experiment.

üßæ Summary

This project demonstrated the dual-use nature of Wi-Fi sniffing ‚Äî as both a diagnostic and a potential attack tool.
Through this hands-on implementation, I strengthened my practical cybersecurity foundation, gaining real-world insight into how ethical hacking and defensive network monitoring are carried out in professional environments.
